As you can imagine, that's a non-trivial amount of knowledge that can become a nightmare to keep track of. In order to make it all manageable, companies with scale would devote internal teams on tooling around Kubernetes. However, those tools primary stay in-house, and every company has to reinvent the wheel."),Object(s.b)("p",null,"The inspiration for Konstellation comes from having worked at two companies that have taken different paths to adopting Kubernetes. At Evie Labs, my previous startup, we went through the steep learning curve to get on Kubernetes. Yet due to a lack of tools, we used Kubernetes raw. It was painful for developers to use: having to hand map YAML resources was extremely error prone. At Medium, we've invested in an impressive set of internal solutions that made Kubernetes practical for developers, but those tools remain tightly coupled to our needs and codebase. Having gone through the same pain points twice, I wanted an open source solution that was robust and easy to use."),Object(s.b)("p",null,"With that thought, I wrote the first line of code for Konstellation in November 2019.
